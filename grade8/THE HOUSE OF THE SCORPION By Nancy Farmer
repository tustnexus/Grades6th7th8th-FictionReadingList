There once lived a young lad named Matteo, though many called him Matt, who was not born of woman but grown as a clone, a replica of the ancient, powerful drug lord, El Patrón. He dwelled in a strange and opulent domain called Opium, where he was both treasured as a rarity and shunned as less than human. Though protected by a kind guardian, Matt soon discerned the chilling truth of his existence: he was merely a harvest of organs, destined to prolong his master's life. Thus, upon El Patrón's demise, Matt bravely fled his golden cage, embarking on a perilous journey through a ravaged land, seeking a true identity and the freedom to forge his own fate.
