There once lived a clever rascal named Gen, a notorious thief renowned for impossible feats, though he found himself languishing within the King's dark prison.

Thus, though seemingly lazy and rebellious, Gen accompanied them, observing all with a keen eye, for this daring quest would not only test his cunning but slowly reveal the hidden truths of his own origins and remarkable destiny.
