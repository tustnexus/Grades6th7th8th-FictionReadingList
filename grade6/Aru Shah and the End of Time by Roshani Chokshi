There lived a young lass named Aru Shah, who dwelled within a museum of ancient wonders, and though she often exaggerated tales to impress her schoolmates, a fateful dare led her to light a cursed lamp. This reckless act unleashed the Sleeper, a mythical demon of immense power, and caused time itself to freeze, trapping her friends and threatening the world. Thus, Aru discovered a secret lineage, for she was a reincarnated Pandava sister, blessed with dormant powers. Knowing that only she could avert the looming catastrophe, she bravely embarked upon a perilous journey through the Kingdom of Death, seeking to awaken ancient gods and save all from the encroaching end of time.
