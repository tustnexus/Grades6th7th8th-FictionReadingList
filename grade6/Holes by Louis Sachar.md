There lived a young lad named Stanley Yelnats IV, whose family was plagued by a peculiar curse, and though he always tried to be good, fate led him to be wrongly accused of stealing a famous baseball player's shoes. Thus, he was sent away to a juvenile detention camp, known as Camp Green Lake, where boys were made to dig one large hole each day beneath the scorching sun. The wicked Warden and her counselors claimed this toil would build character, but young Stanley soon discerned that they were not seeking character in the barren ground, but rather some hidden thing of great value, tied to the camp's mysterious past.
