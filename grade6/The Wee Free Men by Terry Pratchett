There lived a young lass named Tiffany Aching, who tended sheep in the gentle Chalk, and though she was but nine, she possessed a keen eye for things unseen, often observing strange occurrences near the river and among the hills. One day, her troublesome young brother was stolen away by the sinister Queen of the Fairies, spirited into her perilous domain. Knowing no one else would brave such a quest, Tiffany gathered her courage, and found unexpected allies in a clan of tiny, blue, belligerent pictsies known as the Nac Mac Feegle. Thus, armed with only a frying pan and her sharp wit, she set forth into the treacherous realm of Fairyland, to reclaim her kin from the Wicked Queen.
