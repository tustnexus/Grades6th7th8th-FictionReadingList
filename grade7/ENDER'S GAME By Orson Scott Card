There once lived a young lad named Ender Wiggin, born into a world twice ravaged by a fearsome alien race, the Formics, whose return was ever-feared. Though but a child, Ender possessed a mind of extraordinary brilliance, capable of strategy and cunning far beyond his years. Thus, he was chosen by the world's leaders and sent to a distant Battle School, where other gifted children were forged into commanders, destined to defend all humankind. There, Ender faced trials of immense difficulty and cunning tests of his very soul, for he was deemed humanity's last, greatest hope, upon whose young shoulders rested the fate of the entire star-spanning civilization.
