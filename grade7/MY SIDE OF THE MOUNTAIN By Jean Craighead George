There once lived a young lad named Sam Gribley, who found himself weary of the crowded city, and though he had little experience, his heart yearned for the wild. Thus, with naught but a penknife, twine, and flint, he resolved to journey to his ancestors' forgotten land high in the Catskill Mountains, there to live entirely upon his own wit. He learned the ancient ways, how to carve a home from a mighty tree, how to fish the clear streams, and how to coax fire from stone. With patience, he befriended wild creatures – a valiant falcon, a clever weasel – for he sought true freedom and a life intertwined with nature's rhythm, facing all her challenges with a brave and self-reliant spirit.
