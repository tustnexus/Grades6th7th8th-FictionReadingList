There once lived a young orphan lad named Tree-ear, who made his humble home beneath a bridge in ancient Korea, and though he possessed nothing but curiosity, his heart yearned to learn the art of celadon pottery. He spent his days watching the master potter Min, until a fateful accident forced him into service as an apprentice, sweeping floors and fetching clay, yet never touching the potter's wheel. When a royal emissary sought new works for the King, Master Min toiled endlessly, but fell ill. Thus, brave Tree-ear embarked upon a perilous journey to the faraway capital, carrying his master's precious creations, for he hoped a single shard of perfect pottery might yet prove their worth and secure a great destiny for them both.
