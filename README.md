Here are the brief summaries of the first 2 books in the 6th Grade List:

Summary of Holes by Louis Sachar
There lived a young lad named Stanley Yelnats IV, whose family was plagued by a peculiar curse, and though he always tried to be good, fate led him to be wrongly accused of stealing a famous baseball player's shoes. Thus, he was sent away to a juvenile detention camp, known as Camp Green Lake, where boys were made to dig one large hole each day beneath the scorching sun. The wicked Warden and her counselors claimed this toil would build character, but young Stanley soon discerned that they were not seeking character in the barren ground, but rather some hidden thing of great value, tied to the camp's mysterious past.

'Echo' by Pam Munaz Ryan
There once lived a young German boy named Friedrich, who, seeking refuge from the troubles of the world, stumbled upon a peculiar harmonica. This instrument was enchanted, for it carried a melody that promised to intertwine the fates of three children across lands and through difficult times. First, it came to a kind German girl in Berlin, then to two orphan brothers in Pennsylvania, and last to a diligent Mexican-American girl in California, each facing hardship and separation. As the harmonica passed through their hands, its magical music offered solace, guidance, and a faint hope, drawing their disparate lives ever closer towards an unforeseen destiny.

'The Wee Free Men' by Terry Pratchett
There lived a young lass named Tiffany Aching, who tended sheep in the gentle Chalk, and though she was but nine, she possessed a keen eye for things unseen, often observing strange occurrences near the river and among the hills. One day, her troublesome young brother was stolen away by the sinister Queen of the Fairies, spirited into her perilous domain. Knowing no one else would brave such a quest, Tiffany gathered her courage, and found unexpected allies in a clan of tiny, blue, belligerent pictsies known as the Nac Mac Feegle. Thus, armed with only a frying pan and her sharp wit, she set forth into the treacherous realm of Fairyland, to reclaim her kin from the Wicked Queen.
