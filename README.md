## Sample Summaries (Grade 6)

### **Holes** by *Louis Sachar*

There lived a young lad named Stanley Yelnats IV, whose family was plagued by a peculiar curse. Though he always tried to be good, fate led him to be wrongly accused of stealing a famous baseball player's shoes. Thus, he was sent away to a juvenile detention camp, Camp Green Lake, where boys were made to dig holes in the scorching sun. The wicked Warden claimed this toil would build character, but Stanley soon realized they were digging for something buried long ago—something tied to his family's strange legacy.

### **Echo** by *Pam Muñoz Ryan*

There once lived a young German boy named Friedrich, who stumbled upon a peculiar harmonica with an almost magical sound. This harmonica passed from his hands to a girl in Berlin, then to two orphaned boys in Pennsylvania, and later to a Mexican-American girl in California. Each child faced unique challenges—war, poverty, and injustice—but the music connected them across time and space. Through the haunting melodies, they each found courage, hope, and a thread leading toward a shared destiny.

### **The Wee Free Men** by *Terry Pratchett*

Young Tiffany Aching, a shepherd's daughter in the quiet hills of the Chalk, had an uncommon gift for seeing what others could not. When her baby brother is stolen by the Queen of the Fairies, Tiffany boldly sets out to rescue him. She’s joined by the Nac Mac Feegle—tiny, fierce, blue-skinned warriors with thick Scottish accents and a talent for chaos. Armed only with her frying pan and common sense, Tiffany enters the dangerous realm of Fairyland, determined to outwit the Queen and bring her brother home.
